# speech-to-text-converter
This project perfroms speech-to-text converters using two modules: DeepSpeech and Whisper. Both models can transcribe audio files and live microphone input into text. DeepSpeech is lightweight and works offline, while Whisper offers higher accuracy and supports multiple languages. Ideal for real-time or batch transcription tasks.
